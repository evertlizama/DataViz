      <h1>Everts Bio</h1>
        <p>Hi everyone and welcome to my page. First off, thanks for visiting! I recently enrolled in the data analytics course because I took an interest in data analytics. I feel that this is the industry that is growing and I want to be part of it.</p>
        <p>
          A little bit of a background about myself, born and raised in MD attended the university of maryland to study accounting and information systems. Here is where I really gained interest in technology and wanted to pursue it. Currently a student in the UT data analytics course. Cheers! </p>
